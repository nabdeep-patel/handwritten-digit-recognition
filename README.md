## Project Overview

📝 In this project, I have developed a model capable of accurately classifying and recognizing handwritten digits using the MNIST Data. Leveraging the power of machine learning, particularly utilizing the Relu Function.

Subsequently, we evaluated its performance on a separate test dataset. Our model got a test accuracy of 97%.

## About Relu

🏗️ Our model architecture adopts a deep learning approach tailored for handwritten digit recognition. It comprises a sequential stack of layers, including dense (fully connected) layers along with an output layer. Each dense layer is accompanied by an activation function to introduce non-linearity, thereby enhancing the model's capacity to capture complex patterns.

🔍 **Model Architecture:**

1. **Input Layer:** Accepts the flattened pixel values of the input image.
2. **Dense Layer:** Comprising multiple neurons to extract features from the data.
3. **Activation Function:** Injects non-linearity into the model.
4. **Output Layer:** Yields the final prediction for the digit class.

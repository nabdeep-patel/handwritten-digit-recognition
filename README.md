# Handwritten Digit Recognition using MNIST Data

This project aims to demonstrate the implementation of a handwritten digit recognition system using the MNIST dataset. The MNIST dataset consists of a large collection of labeled handwritten digits, commonly used as a benchmark in the field of machine learning and computer vision.

## Project Overview

In this project, we have developed a model that can classify and recognize handwritten digits. We leverage the power of machine learning (Relu Function) to train a model on a subset of the MNIST dataset and then evaluate its performance on a separate test set. The model uses a neural network architecture to learn the patterns and features present in the images of handwritten digits.

## Installation

To run this project on your local machine, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine using `git clone https://github.com/nabdeep-patel/handwritten-digit-recognition.git`.

2. Install the required dependencies by running `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

3. Execute the main script by running `Handwritten Digit Classification.ipynb`.

## Model Architecture

We have employed a deep learning architecture for this handwritten digit recognition task. The model consists of a sequential stack of layers, including dense (fully connected) layers and an output layer. Each dense layer is followed by an activation function to introduce non-linearity.

The architecture of the model is as follows:

1. Input Layer: Accepts the flattened pixel values of the input image.
2. Dense Layer: Composed of multiple neurons to learn features from the data.
3. Activation Function: Introduces non-linearity to the model.
4. Output Layer: Produces the final prediction for the digit class.

## Results and Evaluation

The model's performance is evaluated using a test set that was not seen during training. We measure metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to assess how well the model generalizes to new data. The evaluation helps us understand the model's ability to correctly classify handwritten digits.

## Usage

The provided `Handwritten Digit Classification.ipynb` script demonstrates how to load the trained model, preprocess new images, and make predictions. You can modify the script to load your own images or integrate the model into your application.
